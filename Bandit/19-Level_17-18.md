#### LEVEL 18 to LEVEL 18

**Target:**  
The next password is obtained by sending the current password to a service running on localhost between **ports 31000–32000.**
First, find which ports are open. Then check which ones use SSL/TLS.
Only one server will return the correct credentials — the others will just echo your input back.

**Information:**
