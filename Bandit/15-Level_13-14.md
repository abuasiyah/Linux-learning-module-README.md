The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14, but it is only readable by user bandit14, so you cannot access it directly. Instead, you are given a private SSH key. This key must be used to SSH into the next level, just like previous Bandit logins, but using key-based authentication instead of a password.
