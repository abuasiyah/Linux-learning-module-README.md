#### LEVEL 11 to LEVEL 12

**Target:**  
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14, but it is only readable by user bandit14, so you cannot access it directly. Instead, you are given a private SSH key. This key must be used to SSH into the next level, just like previous Bandit logins, but using key-based authentication instead of a password.

**Information:**  
*Commands we may need to solve this level*

ssh – Connects to a remote machine securely
Example: ssh user@host

scp – Securely copies files between machines
Example: scp file.txt user@host:/path

umask – Sets default file permission mask
Example: umask 022

chmod – Changes file permissions
Example: chmod 600 key.pem

cat – Displays file contents
Example: cat file.txt

nc (netcat) – Reads/writes data over network connections
Example: nc localhost 3000

install – Copies files and sets ownership/permissions
Example: install -m 755 app /usr/local/bin/app

**Execution:**  
Once we have entred bandit11, we will first type the command ls to list the files that is in the home directory.
``` bash
ls

We found the *data.txt* file. we will use the cat command to display the *data.txt* file, pipe (**|**)
to allow us to put in another command, and lastly will use the tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' commad to translate the **data.txt** file.
What does 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' do: Performs ROT13 encryption/decryption (letter substitution).

``` bash
cat data.txt |  tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```

With this we have the password 

``` bash
7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
```
We will now log out and log back in on bandit12 with this password
