#### LEVEL 13 to LEVEL 14

**Target:**  
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14, but it is only readable by user bandit14, so you cannot access it directly. Instead, you are given a private SSH key. This key must be used to SSH into the next level, just like previous Bandit logins, but using key-based authentication instead of a password.

**Information:**  
*Commands we may need to solve this level*

ssh – Connects to a remote machine securely
Example: ssh user@host

scp – Securely copies files between machines
Example: scp file.txt user@host:/path

umask – Sets default file permission mask
Example: umask 022

chmod – Changes file permissions
Example: chmod 600 key.pem

cat – Displays file contents
Example: cat file.txt

nc (netcat) – Reads/writes data over network connections
Example: nc localhost 3000

install – Copies files and sets ownership/permissions
Example: install -m 755 app /usr/local/bin/app

**Execution:**  
Once we have entered bandit13, we will first type the command ls to list the files that is in the home directory.
``` bash
ls
```

We found the *sshkey.private* file. We will use the cat command to display the *sshkey.private* file, copy the displayed file, and then exit bandit13

Once we have made a file and copied our private key, we will change the file permission to 600 so that only user can read and write.
```bash
chmod 600 sshkey.private  
```

If group or others can access the key, SSH refuses to use it to prevent key theft. that is because if others can read your private key, they can log in as you. 
ssh → starts an SSH connection

Now we will authenticate as bandit14 using an SSH private key.

```bash
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
**-i sshkey.private** → uses your private key file  
**bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org** → user and server  
**-p 2220** → connects on port 2220 

Now that we are logged into bandit14, we will use cat to display the password that stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

``` bash
 cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
```

With this we have the password

``` bash

```
As we are already login to bandit14, will just continue from there.
