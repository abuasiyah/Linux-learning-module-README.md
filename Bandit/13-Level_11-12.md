#### LEVEL 11 to LEVEL 12

**Target:**  
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

**Information:**

uniq – Filters or reports repeated lines

tar – Archives multiple files into one
Example: tar -cvf archive.tar folder/

gzip – Compresses files using gzip
Example: gzip file.txt

We found the *data.txt* file. we will use the cat command to display the *data.txt* file, pipe (**|**)
to allow us to put in another command, and lastly will use the tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' commad to translate the **data.txt** file.
What does 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' do: Performs ROT13 encryption/decryption (letter substitution).

``` bash
cat data.txt |  tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```

With this we have the password 

``` bash
7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
```
We will now log out and log back in on bandit12 with this password
