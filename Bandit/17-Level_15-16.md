#### LEVEL 15 to LEVEL 16

**Target:**  
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **port 30001 on localhost** using SSL/TLS encryption

**Information:**  
*Commands we may need to solve this level*

ssh – Securely connect to a remote system
Example: ssh user@host

telnet – Connect to a remote host using an unencrypted protocol (legacy)
Example: telnet host port

nc (netcat) – Read/write data over network connections (very versatile)
Example: nc host port

ncat – Improved Netcat with encryption and more features
Example: ncat --ssl host port

socat – Relay data between two endpoints (ports, files, sockets)
Example: socat TCP-LISTEN:1234 TCP:host:80

openssl – Cryptography toolkit (SSL/TLS, certificates, encryption)
Example: openssl version

openssl s_client – Test and connect to SSL/TLS services
Example: openssl s_client -connect host:443

nmap – Scan networks and discover hosts/services
Example: nmap host

netstat – Show network connections and listening ports (legacy)
Example: netstat -tuln

ss – Modern replacement for netstat (faster, more detailed)
Example: ss -tuln

**Execution:**  

We will use openssl s_client command to connect and to inspect SSL/TLS services.
``` bash
openssl s_client localhost:30001
```
Once we have done that, we will submit the bandit15 password   

``` bash
8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo
```

With this we have the password 

``` bash
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
```
We will now log out and log back in on bandit16 with this password
