#### LEVEL 12 to LEVEL 13

**Target:**  
The next level’s password is hidden in data.txt, which contains a hexdump of a repeatedly compressed file. Create a temporary working directory (preferably with mktemp -d), copy the file there using cp, and rename it with mv to safely extract and analyze it.

**Information:**  
*Commands we will use for this level*

**mktemp -d**
Creates a unique temporary working directory in /tmp.

**cp**  
Copies data.txt to the temp directory so the original stays untouched.

**cd**  
Moves into the working directory.

**xxd -r**  
Reverses a hexdump back into its original binary form.

**file**  
Identifies the true file type (critical for choosing the right decompression tool).

**mv**  
Renames files so decompression tools recognize the format.

**gzip -d** 
Decompresses .gz files.

**bunzip2**
Decompresses .bz2 files.

**tar -xf**
Extracts .tar archives.

**cat**  
Displays the final readable file containing the password.

**Execution:**  

1. We will create a temporary working directory
2. We wil change our current directory to the directory we created
3. we will copy the repeatedly compressed file to our new directory

``` bash
mktemp -d /tmp/SaF.XXX
cd /tmp/SaF.qnF
cp ~/data.txt .

```

These are the steps  i will take  
reversing the Hexdump using xxd -r
``` bash
xxd -r data > data_new
```
xxd = creates or reverses hex dumps  
-r = reverse hexdump back into binary  
**>** = redirects output into a new file  

This turns readable hex back into the original binary data

Use the mv command to rename the file
``` bash
mv data_new data_new.gz
```

will us the gzip -d command to decompresses the .gz file
``` bash
gzip -d data_new.gz
```

Core Workflow
> file → mv → decompress


With this we have the password 

``` bash
7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
```
We will now log out and log back in on bandit12 with this password
