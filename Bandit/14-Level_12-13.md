#### LEVEL 12 to LEVEL 13

**Target:**  
The next level’s password is hidden in data.txt, which contains a hexdump of a repeatedly compressed file. Create a temporary working directory (preferably with mktemp -d), copy the file there using cp, and rename it with mv to safely extract and analyze it.

**Information:**  
*Commands we will use for this level*

**mktemp -d**
Creates a unique temporary working directory in /tmp.

**cp**  
Copies data.txt to the temp directory so the original stays untouched.

**cd**  
Moves into the working directory.

**xxd -r**  
Reverses a hexdump back into its original binary form.

**file**  
Identifies the true file type (critical for choosing the right decompression tool).

**mv**  
Renames files so decompression tools recognize the format.

**gzip -d** 
Decompresses .gz files.

**bunzip2**
Decompresses .bz2 files.

**tar -xf**
Extracts .tar archives.

**cat**  
Displays the final readable file containing the password.

**Execution:**  

Once we have entred bandit12, this are the steps will do:   
1. We will create a temporary working directory
2. We wil change our current directory to the directory we created
3. we will copy the repeatedly compressed file to our new directory

``` bash
mktemp -d /tmp/SaF.XXX
cd /tmp/SaF.qnF
cp ~/data.txt .

```

These are the steps  i will take  
reversing the Hexdump using xxd -r
``` bash
xxd -r data > data_new
```
xxd = creates or reverses hex dumps  
-r = reverse hexdump back into binary  
**>** = redirects output into a new file  

This turns readable hex back into the original binary data

Use the mv command to rename the file
``` bash
mv data_new data_new.gz
```

will us the gzip -d command to decompresses the .gz file. we would decompresses the file with bzip2 if the file is .bz2

``` bash
gzip -d data_new.gz
```

When typing file data_new, we can see a a bzip2 file

<img width="384" height="32" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b127bcc-2ec3-499e-bb8f-3472c87c5fbc" />

If we get tar when we type file to identifies the file type, will use the tar command to extracts .tar archives
``` bash
tar -xf data_new
```  
-x = extract  
-f = file

we will repeat this cycle until we get a file that ASCII text.  

Core Workflow  
> file → mv → decompress

When we reach data8, do we get what we are looking for and we can use the cat command to display the file

<img width="377" height="59" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b5e085d-28e9-4238-8ec7-f834ff9be9f0" />

With this we have the password 

``` bash
FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn
```
We will now log out and log back in on bandit13 with this password
