We found the *inhere* file. We will now use the cd command to change the directory 
``` bash
cd inhere/
```
Once we are in the *inhere* directory, we will use ls again to list the file that are stored in the directory. We can see that we have 20 files.

We can use the cat command and list the files one after the other, but that will be time-consuming. knowing i had to find a specific size a typed man find to look for someting that will help us look for size of a file.
``` bash
man find
```
Then we type / and type your looking for, so we type *size* to see if *find* manual has something that looks for a specific size. We can look for size.

``` bash
find -size 1033c
```
<img width="336" height="29" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9016c93f-aba4-41cd-8cb8-a445faa128eb" />

We have now found 1 file with that file size. we will now use cat to display that file

``` bash
cat ./maybehere07/.file2
```

With this we have the password 

``` bash
HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG
```
We will now log out and log back in on bandit6 with this password
