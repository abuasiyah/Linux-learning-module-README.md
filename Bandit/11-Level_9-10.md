We found the *data.txt* file. we will use the sort command to make sure all the lines in the text of *data.txt* is sorted in order, pipe (**|**)
to allow us to put in another command, and lastly will use the uniq command with the -u argument (found in the uniq manual) to filter the uniq line of the **data.txt** file.
``` bash
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```

With this we have the password
