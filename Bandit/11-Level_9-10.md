We found the *data.txt* file. we will use the strings command to extract readable text from *data.txt* file, pipe (**|**)
to allow us to put in another command, and lastly will use the grep command to seacrh for "=" characters in the **data.txt** file.
``` bash
strings data.txt | grep "==="
```

With this we have the password
