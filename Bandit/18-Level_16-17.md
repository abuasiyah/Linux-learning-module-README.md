#### LEVEL 16 to LEVEL 17

**Target:**  
The next password is obtained by sending the current password to a service running on localhost between **ports 31000–32000.**
First, find which ports are open. Then check which ones use SSL/TLS.
Only one server will return the correct credentials — the others will just echo your input back.

**Information:**  
*Commands we may need to solve this level*

ssh – Securely connect to a remote system
Example: ssh user@host

telnet – Connect to a remote host using an unencrypted protocol (legacy)
Example: telnet host port

nc (netcat) – Read/write data over network connections (very versatile)
Example: nc host port

ncat – Improved Netcat with encryption and more features
Example: ncat --ssl host port

socat – Relay data between two endpoints (ports, files, sockets)
Example: socat TCP-LISTEN:1234 TCP:host:80

openssl – Cryptography toolkit (SSL/TLS, certificates, encryption)
Example: openssl version

openssl s_client – Test and connect to SSL/TLS services
Example: openssl s_client -connect host:443

nmap – Scan networks and discover hosts/services
Example: nmap host

netstat – Show network connections and listening ports (legacy)
Example: netstat -tuln

ss – Modern replacement for netstat (faster, more detailed)
Example: ss -tuln

**Execution:**  
Once we have entered bandit16, we will use **nmap -p** to scan a specific range of ports on a target.

``` bash
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
```

We check the ports using the same command as last time.


``` bash
openssl s_client -connect  host:port
```
Some of the port gives you KEYUPDATE when you put down the password: kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx

When we check CONNECTED COMMANDS on the manual for openssl s_client we ca see that if we put own anything starting with
the letter **k** sends a key update messege to server.we can see our password start with the letter **k**

So to avoid this we will use the -quite argument which suppresses extra SSL debug output and only shows the actual data exchanged.
Once we use this and put in the password we get 31790 port that gives use something back.

```bash
openssl s_client -quiet  localhost:31790
```
``` bash
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
```

Now that we have a private key, we will do the same thing we did in level 13 to level 14.
Here is the steps
1. copy the private key.
2. exit bandit16
3. create a file and past the private key (touch private.key)  
``` bash
touch private.key
vim private.key
```  
5. change the file permission to user read an right only  
``` bash
chmod 600 private.key
```

Now we will authenticate as bandit17 using an SSH private key.
```bash
 ssh -i private.key bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Now that we are logged into bandit17, we will use cat to display the password that stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17

``` bash
 cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17
```

 We have now found the password for bandit17
```bash
