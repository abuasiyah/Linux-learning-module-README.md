#### LEVEL 18 to LEVEL 19

**Target:**  
The password for the next level is stored in a file **readme** in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified **.bashrc** to log you out when you log in with SSH.

**Information:**  
*Commands we may need to solve this level*

ssh – Connects to another machine securely  
Example: ssh user@host  
ls – Lists files and directories  
Example: ls -la  
cat – Displays file contents  
Example: cat file.txt  

**Execution:**  
Loging into bandit18 doesn't work due to it being modified.

Knowing that the password is stored in the file called readme and it is in the homedirectory, we will use the cat command at the end to display the password on bandit19
``` bash
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat readme"
```
What it does:  
**"cat readme"** – runs cat readme remotely and exits immediately

Why this works for Bandit18:  
Bandit18 logs you out immediately after login.
By passing a command in quotes, SSH runs it before the logout happens.
This lets you read the readme file without getting an interactive shell

 With this we have the password 

``` bash
cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8
```
With this we can log into bandit19
