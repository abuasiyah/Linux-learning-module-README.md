#### LEVEL 14 to LEVEL 15

**Target:**  
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

**Information:**  
*Commands we may need to solve this level*

ssh – Securely connect to a remote machine
Example: ssh user@host

telnet – Connect to a remote service (unencrypted, legacy)
Example: telnet host port

nc (netcat) – Read/write data over network connections
Example: nc host port

openssl – Toolkit for SSL/TLS and encryption tasks
Example: openssl s_client -connect host:port

s_client – OpenSSL command to test SSL/TLS connections
Example: openssl s_client -connect localhost:443

nmap – Scan networks and discover open ports/services
Example: nmap localhost

**Execution:**  
We will use nc command to read the data on port 30000 on the localhost
``` bash
nc localhost 30000
```
Once we have done that, we will submit the bandit14 password
