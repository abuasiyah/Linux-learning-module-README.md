#### LEVEL 19 to LEVEL 20

**Target:**  
Use the **setuid program** in the home directory.Run it **without any arguments** to see how it works.
After using it, you can read the password from /etc/bandit_pass.

what does **setuid program** do?  
When a file has setuid set, it runs as the file owner, not as the user who executes it.so it is like sudo without these 3 things:  
1.You don’t type sudo  
2.No password prompt  
3.You can only do what that program allows, nothing more  

**Execution:**  
Once we log into bandit19, we will use ls command to see the *setuid program* name

we will run that setuid without ay arguments
```bash
./bandit20-do
```
Here is the printed output 

> Run a command as another user.  
> Example: ./bandit20-do whoami

This means we can execute a program using another user’s permissions instead of our own.  
with this we will use the setuid with the cat command to display password for bandit20 located at /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20  

```bash
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
```

With this we have the password 

``` bash
0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
```
We will now log out and log back in on bandit20 with this password
